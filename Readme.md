# Scala Programming.
=
- Working on scala, a scalable language which fully object oriented and uses functional programming concepts. Scala was written by Martin Ordesky in 2001 and opensourced in 2004. 

- This is a very powerful language, written on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It uses all the Java libraries and can import static classes in the java language. 

- Scala is compressed and focuses on reducing verbosity of the java language. It has functions, methods and classes and objects. It has higher order functions known as Lambda functions (unonimous functions).
